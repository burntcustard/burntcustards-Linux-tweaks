# Gnome Tweaks
Changes I've made to set things up just the way I like it, mostly via the Gnome Tweaks utility.


### Appearance
Applications: Numix  
`$ sudo apt install numix-gtk-theme`  
Icons: Papirus-Adapta  
`$ sudo apt install papirus-icon-theme`  
Background: TODO: When on WiFi add link to nice background image or two.


### Extensions
Some of these come with Gnome Tweaks, some need to be found on https://extensions.gnome.org/  
* Activities configurator
* Alternatetab
* Dash to panel
* Icon hider


### Misc
The main color for taskbars etc. is Numix's default #444.
